This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently one of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.



There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

------

kubectl rollout history deploy nginx-deployment

kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment    -   rollback to previous version 

kubectl rollout undo daemonset/abc --to-revision=3  -   rollback to specific version.
