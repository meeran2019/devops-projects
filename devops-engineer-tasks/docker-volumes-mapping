The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:



a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name demo from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/sysops with container volume /usr/src/. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/sysops. Also please keep the container in running state.

------

1. TO pull latest nginx image: 

    docker pull nginx:latest

2. To run the container. 

    docker run -d -v /opt/sysops:/usr/src/ --name demo nginx:latest

3. Copy the file to container.

    docker cp /tmp/sample.txt 30b35aa481b1:/opt/sysops/

Verify: 

    docker exec -it 30b35 /bin/bash
