We deployed a Nginx and PHPFPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:



The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Figure out the issue and fix the same.

Once issue is fixed, copy /home/thor/index.php file from jump host into nginx-container under nginx document root and you should be able to access the website using Website button on top bar.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

    kubectl cp source/path/file container-name:destination/path/file 
    kubectl cp  /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html/
