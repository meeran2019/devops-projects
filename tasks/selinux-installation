Introduction: 
    Security Enhanced Linux. 

    SELinux is Mandatory Access Control system.
    For priviled users, got higher level access and cause security issues. 
        It restrict users and process to bound to specific policy. 
        SELinux resolves the issue by both confining privileged access and automating security policy creation.

        From SELinuxâ€™s perspective, a Linux system is divided into a number of different objects. Objects, for example, are all files, processes, users, sockets, and pipes in a system. In a SELinux context, every such object gets a special label. SELinux policies are the rules to control access to these objects using the labels defined on them:

        SELinux default DENY unless explicitly allowed.

        It has 2 global modes, 
            permissive  -   It functions like Discretinary Access Control (DAC) but logging violation to SELinux. 
            enforcing   -   It applies strict policy not to allow any unless explicitily allowed.

Installation: 

    sudo rpm -aq | grep selinux
    yum install policycoreutils-python setools setools-console setroubleshoot* policycoreutils-devel

Configuration:               

    /etc/selinux/config

    SELINUX=disabled / enforcing / permissive 

Modes and Status: 

    getenforce              -   To check current SELinux mode. 
    sestatus                -   To set the status.
    setenforce permissive   -   TO set the permission.
