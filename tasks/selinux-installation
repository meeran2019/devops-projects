Introduction: 
    Security Enhanced Linux. 

    SELinux is Mandatory Access Control system.
    For priviled users, got higher level access and cause security issues. 
        It restrict users and process to bound to specific policy. 
        SELinux resolves the issue by both confining privileged access and automating security policy creation.

        SELinux default DENY unless explicitly allowed.

        It has 2 global modes, 
            permissive  -   It functions like Discretinary Access Control (DAC) but logging violation to SELinux. 
            enforcing   -   It applies strict policy not to allow any unless explicitily allowed.

    /etc/selinux/config
